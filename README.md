# 🍽️ DineSight – Restaurant Review Analysis using NLP  

## 📌 Project Overview  
**DineSight** is an intelligent restaurant review system designed to bridge the gap between **customer satisfaction** and **restaurant owners’ decision-making**. It provides **real-time feedback** from customer reviews, helping food startups and restaurant chains analyze customer preferences, likes, and dislikes based on their comments.  

The system enables customers to submit reviews easily, while owners can securely access a dashboard to monitor feedback and take data-driven actions.
